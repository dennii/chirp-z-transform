# Chirp Z-Transform
Implementation of the Chirp Z-Transform and its inverse. This is a straightforward implementation (in Python, using numpy and scipy) of the algorithms described in

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;V. Sukhoy and A. Stoytchev, Generalizing the inverse FFT off the unit circle. *Sci Rep* **9**, 14443 (2019).

Since the real work has been done by Sukhoy and Stoytchev (a fast algorithm for the Chirp Z-Transform has been known for a long time, but a fast inverse was only discovered recently by Sukhoy and Stoytchev), I am releasing this code into the public domain.
